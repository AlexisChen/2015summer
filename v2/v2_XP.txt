-add comment on code to improve readability
-for search.php, instead of random function names, give functions more intuitive names
so that programmers who touch the code later can easily know what the function does
-split deep function calls into smaller block of code in search.php so the logic is clearer 
code is also easier to read in such ways 
-for search.php delete commented lines and not used code
