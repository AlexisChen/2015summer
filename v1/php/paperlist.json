Recently, the type-2 fuzzy logic systems (T2 FLSs) have been found effective in modeling uncertain data. This paper examines the potential of the T2 FLS methodology in devising an EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI). In particular, a T2 FLS has been designed to classify imaginary left and right hand movements based on time-frequency information extracted from the EEG with the short time Fourier transform (STFT). Robustness of the method has also been verified in the presence of additive noise. The performance of the classifier is quantified with the classification accuracy (CA). The T2 fuzzy classifier has been proven to outperform its type-1 (T1) counterpart on all data sets recorded from three subjects examined. It has also compared favorably to the well known classifier based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA)","filepath":"..\/paper\/paper1.pdf"},{"paperId":1,"paperTitle":"Theory of soliton stability in asynchronous modelocking","author":["H.

Learning is a progressive activity which builds upon those of the previous day(s). Reading material and working independently do not compensate for the loss of insight gained by being physically present in classroom environment. As a result attendance monitoring should be an integral part of any institution especially a tertiary institution. The major challenge that a facilitator has in monitoring attendance is the sheer paper work and subsequent administrative work that follows the process if it is done manually. Many techniques have been developed to automate attendance monitoring including the use of biometrics. These techniques have their own strengths and weaknesses. This paper describes a pilot experiment that was rolled out at the Central University Of Technology, Free State, South Africa where a Java based Radio Frequency Identification Technology (RFID) application was used to automate attendance monitoring. The paper first compares the challenges facing manual attendance monitoring. Secondly it looks at some of the possible solutions for automating attendance monitoring including RFID technology. Thirdly it shows how the hardware part is setup and finally it describes how Java programming is used to create a meaningful link between the data collected by the RFID hardware so as to automate the attendance register.","filepath":"..\/paper\/paper4.pdf"},{"paperId":4,"paperTitle":"Interferometry using a multi-photon tunneling coupler","author":["J.

Interferometers involving special quantum states can show fascinating and counter-intuitive effects. While the general principles governing these effects have been understood for some time, the recent discussion of photon DeBroglie waves has provided an interesting and useful perspective. The basic idea is that whenever photons display correlated dynamics as they pass through a nonlinear interferometer, a description in terms of multi-photon bound particles can be useful. Multi-photon particles behave quite differently from uncorrelated photons: a bound collection of N photons has total momentum N\/spl planck\/k. Interference of such particles has fringe period \/spl lambda\/\/N. This runs against our intuition for linear optics, although some implementations are intuitive. For example, if a system includes up-conversion, then \/spl lambda\/\/2 photons are produced, and the presence of interference at this wavelength is quite natural. Naturally, loss will impose limitations on this kind of coherent manipulation, and must be carefully studied. The Kerr coupler was proposed as a potential implementation of the above interferometer. The Kerr effect can provide a \"binding force\" holding a packet of photons together as it passes through the coupler. A number of issues must be addressed in any realistic design-including loss and temporal pulse shape. Here we study the basic effect using a simplified two-mode model.","filepath":"..\/paper\/paper5.pdf"},{"paperId":5,"paperTitle":"The ARTEMIS Cross-Domain Architecture for Embedded Systems","author":["Hermann Kopetz"],"conference":"2007 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition","linkToDownload":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4212016","linkToBib":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4212016","abstract":"Today the embedded system market is a highly fragmented market, where custom-designed solutions dominate, resulting in a significant duplication of development effort for hardware, software and services.

Although there are plenty of publications describing the performance of the DDS, there has up to now not been any direct comparison between the performance of the DDS and the VCO as applied in FM-CW radars. In this paper the performance of DDS is analyzed both theoretically and with measurements. The performance of DDS in a linear frequency modulated continuous wave (LFM-CW) radar system, (the Transportable Atmospheric Radar TARA developed in IRCTR), is compared to a VCO demonstrating its superiority. DDS is, therefore, expected to play an important role in radar systems in the near future.","filepath":"..\/paper\/paper9.pdf"},{"paperId":9,"paperTitle":"A Petawatt Class Laser Irradiation System for Laser-Matter Interactions","author":["D.

It is proven that this corresponds to a critical hole fluence, since a unique relationship between electron trap generation and hole fluence is found independent of stress field and oxide thickness. In this way literature models relating breakdown to hole fluence or to trap generation are linked. A new model for intrinsic breakdown, based on a percolation concept, is proposed. It is shown that this model can explain the experimentally observed statistical features of the breakdown distribution, such as the increasing spread of the QBD-distribution for ultrathin oxides. An important consequence of this large spread is the strong area dependence of the QBD for ultrathin oxides","filepath":"..\/paper\/paper13.pdf"},{"paperId":13,"paperTitle":"Letters to the editor","author":["F.

This paper has two contributions. First, it extends our framework to include task constraints (e.g. tracking a curve) that are not given as explicit functions of time. These constraints are highly relevant in practice, for example to facilitate time-optimal path planning combined with other constraints. Second, it extends our framework to user-configurable task horizons when solving the optimization problem, to allow task programmers to make a trade-off between computational speed and (global) task optimality. Both of these novel framework extensions are illustrated by a time-optimal laser tracing experiment.","filepath":"..\/paper\/paper23.pdf"},{"paperId":23,"paperTitle":"Transient voltages on bonded cable sheaths","author":["Herman Halperin","  J.

The process is applied to the example case design of a 12th order IF filter for color television receivers.","filepath":"..\/paper\/paper30.pdf"},{"paperId":30,"paperTitle":"Teaching abstraction explicitly (poster session)","author":["Herman Koppelman"],"conference":"ACM SIGCSE Bulletin","linkToDownload":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/","linkToBib":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/exportformats.cfm?id=377712&expformat=bibtex","abstract":"When one has to learn programming one has to learn a programming language, but also the concept of abstraction. Learning abstraction is not a logical consequence of learning a programming language. Moreover, it can be doubted whether novice programmers naturally tend to use abstraction. So, our approach is to teach abstraction explicitly to novices. We show that even for simple problems it makes sense to look for levels of abstraction in the problem definition and subsequently to design programs that reflect explicitly those levels of abstraction.We will discuss the way it works on the basis of a simple example.","filepath":"..\/paper\/paper31.pdf"},{"paperId":31,"paperTitle":"Automated contouring of vertical oceanographic sections using an objective analysis","author":["A.

The vertical profiles can be constructed from data collected in a variety of ways. The input data for the driver subroutine need not be equally spaced horizontally or vertically. The routines are written in Fortran for a UNIVAC 1108 with an offline Gould Plotter, but can easily be adapted to any computer with a Fortran compiler and a plotter which accepts Calcomp-like commands. The routines are of modular construction.","filepath":"..\/paper\/paper32.pdf"},{"paperId":32,"paperTitle":"Organic program design","author":["Ted Herman"],"conference":"Proceedings of the 1975 annual conference on   - ACM 75","linkToDownload":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/","linkToBib":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/exportformats.cfm?id=810368&expformat=bibtex","abstract":"The subject of programming methodology has recently become quite popular. Much has already been written about the topic [1], and various new systematic methods have been proposed. In the analysis of programming, many components are separated and their properties investigated. Certain workers have translated these conceptual resolutions into suggestions; often, it is recommended that one type \u201cprogramming activity\u201d be isolated, as far as possible, from another type of programming activity.One common proposal holds that the design of a program and the act of programming should not be miscegenated. This paper, another polemic foray into the area of programming methodology, questions the separation of program design from other programming activities.","filepath":"..\/paper\/paper33.pdf"},{"paperId":33,"paperTitle":"Self-stabilization at WSS'01 and DISC'01","author":["Ted Herman"],"conference":"ACM SIGACT News","linkToDownload":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/","linkToBib":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/exportformats.cfm?id=507467&expformat=bibtex","abstract":null,"filepath":"..\/paper\/paper34.pdf"},{"paperId":34,"paperTitle":"Extra-dimensional island-style FPGAs","author":["Herman Schmit"],"conference":"Proceedings of the 1999 ACM\/SIGDA seventh international symposium on Field programmable gate arrays  - FPGA '99","linkToDownload":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/","linkToBib":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/exportformats.cfm?id=296509&expformat=bibtex","abstract":null,"filepath":"..\/paper\/paper35.pdf"},{"paperId":35,"paperTitle":"From visions to reality","author":["Clem Herman"],"conference":"ACM SIGCAS Computers and Society","linkToDownload":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/","linkToBib":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/exportformats.cfm?id=572310&expformat=bibtex","abstract":null,"filepath":"..\/paper\/paper36.pdf"},{"paperId":36,"paperTitle":"A comparison of disks and tapes","author":["Herman Hess"],"conference":"Communications of the ACM","linkToDownload":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/","linkToBib":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/exportformats.cfm?id=367693&expformat=bibtex","abstract":"The principal characteristics of current magnetic disks and tape units are summarized and compared.

Findings indicate that students differed greatly in their actual use of resources and also in their preferences. Many students preferred resources that could make them study efficiently, such as videos with summaries of subject matter or explanations of hard topics. Students benefitted from links to web resources that go together with relevant information about the resource, in order to be able to make sensible decisions whether to access a resource or not.","filepath":"..\/paper\/paper39.pdf"},{"paperId":39,"paperTitle":"Computer literacy scope and sequence models","author":["Herman Fischer"],"conference":"ACM SIGCUE Outlook","linkToDownload":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/","linkToBib":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/exportformats.cfm?id=951652&expformat=bibtex","abstract":null,"filepath":"..\/paper\/paper40.pdf"},{"paperId":40,"paperTitle":"Exercises as a tool for sharing pedagogical knowledge","author":["Herman Koppelman"],"conference":"Proceedings of the 12th annual SIGCSE conference on Innovation and technology in computer science education  - ITiCSE '07","linkToDownload":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/","linkToBib":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/exportformats.cfm?id=1268933&expformat=bibtex","abstract":"We propose an approach of making pedagogical knowledge of CS instructors explicitly available by coupling it to exercises.","filepath":"..\/paper\/paper41.pdf"},{"paperId":41,"paperTitle":"A database design methodology for an integrated database environment","author":["Marian Herman"],"conference":"ACM SIGMIS Database","linkToDownload":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/","linkToBib":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/exportformats.cfm?id=1113503&expformat=bibtex","abstract":"The database design methodology used by a major US. commercial bank is described.
